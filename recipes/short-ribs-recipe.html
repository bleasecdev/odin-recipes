    <h1>Korean BBQ Short Ribs</h1>
    <img src="../images/short-ribs.jpg" alt="Delicious Short Ribs">

<p>Korean-style short ribs can be found at most Asian markets. The cut, also known as "flanken," refers to a strip of beef cut across the bone from the chuck end of the short ribs. 
    Unlike American and European-style short ribs, which include a thick slice of bone-in beef, Korean-style short ribs are cut lengthwise across the rib bones. 
    The result is a thin strip of meat, about 8 to10 inches in length, lined on 1 side with 1/2-inch thick rib bones. 
    The thin slices make for fast cooking on the grill.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ssesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 large onion, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
        <li>3 Pounds Korean-style short ribs (beef chuck flanken, cut 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick across bones)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Pour soy sauce, water vinegar, and sesame oil into a large, non-metalic bowl. Whisk in 
            onion, garlic, brown sugar, white sugar and pepperm whisking until sugars dissolve. 
            Submerge ribs in the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 7 to 12 hours; the 
            longer the better.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Remove ribs from marinade and shake off excess; discard marinade.</li>

    <h1>Spicy Chicken Soup</h1>
    <img src="../images/spicy-soup.jpg" alt="hot soup">

    <p>Don’t let the name fool you, this soup isn’t overly “spicy,” at least not in the heat-your-mouth-up, Tabasco or hot sauce, kind of way. It simply has a lot of spices in it. 
        The spice level also really depends on what type of salsa you add to it (mild, medium, or hot) to determine how spicy it will be. For mild flavor, 
        add slightly less chili powder and choose a mild salsa. 
        It’s a great soup to make in advance as it tastes even better over time, and you can load it with your favorite Mexican-style toppings, like cilantro, 
        avocado, cotija cheese, and jalapeños.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 cup diced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Saute onion, green pepper and garlic until tender. Stir in chicken broth, chicken pieces and diced tomatoes and chillies.</li>
        <li>Simmer covered for at least 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Mac and cheese is one of those recipes that can take on so many different forms. 
        I love it anyway I can get it but baked mac and cheese is my very favorite and I’ll tell you why… The topping.
