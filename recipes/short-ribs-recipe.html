    <h1>Korean BBQ Short Ribs</h1>
    <img src="../images/short-ribs.jpg" alt="Delicious Short Ribs">

<p>Korean-style short ribs can be found at most Asian markets. The cut, also known as "flanken," refers to a strip of beef cut across the bone from the chuck end of the short ribs. 
    Unlike American and European-style short ribs, which include a thick slice of bone-in beef, Korean-style short ribs are cut lengthwise across the rib bones. 
    The result is a thin strip of meat, about 8 to10 inches in length, lined on 1 side with 1/2-inch thick rib bones. 
    The thin slices make for fast cooking on the grill.</p>
